# Map

A persistent key-value store in contract storage.
This type cannot be instantiated as it is marked with `#[phantom]`. This is by design:
`Map` is a compile-time type that only exists to provide type information for the compiler.
It represents a mapping in storage, but the actual storage operations are handled by the
[`StorageMapReadAccess`](./core-starknet-storage-map-StorageMapReadAccess.md), [`StorageMapWriteAccess`](./core-starknet-storage-map-StorageMapWriteAccess.md), and [`StoragePathEntry`](./core-starknet-storage-map-StoragePathEntry.md) traits.

Fully qualified path: [core](./core.md)::[starknet](./core-starknet.md)::[storage](./core-starknet-storage.md)::[map](./core-starknet-storage-map.md)::[Map](./core-starknet-storage-map-Map.md)
