# Drop

A trait for types that can be safely dropped.
Types implementing `Drop` can be automatically discarded when they go out of scope.
The drop operation is a no-op - it simply indicates to the compiler that this type
can be safely discarded.
# Deriving

This trait can be automatically derived using `#[derive(Drop)]`. All basic types
implement `Drop` by default, except for `Felt252Dict`.
# Examples

Without `Drop`:
```cairo
struct Point {
    x: u128,
    y: u128,
}

fn foo(p: Point) {} // Error: `p` cannot be dropped
```

With `Drop`:
```cairo
#[derive(Drop)]
struct Point {
    x: u128,
    y: u128,
}

fn foo(p: Point) {} // OK: `p` is dropped at the end of the function
```
