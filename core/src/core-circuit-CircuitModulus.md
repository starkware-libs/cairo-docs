# CircuitModulus

A type that can be used as a circuit modulus (a u384 that is not zero or one).
The modulus defines the finite field over which the circuit operates. It must be:
- A 384-bit number (represented as four 96-bit limbs)
- Not zero or one
- Typically a prime number for cryptographic applications
