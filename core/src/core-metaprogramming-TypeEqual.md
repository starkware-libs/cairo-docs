# TypeEqual

A trait that can be used to disable implementations based on the types of the generic args.
Assumes that `TypeEqualImpl<T>` is the only implementation of this trait.
Primarily used for optimizations by enabling type-specific implementations.
Since `TypeEqualImpl<T>` is the only implementation, adding `-TypeEqual<T, U>` as a trait
bound ensures the implementation is only available when T and U are different types.
