Common Library
==============

This page summarizes library functions available in the Cairo common library.
The common library is written in Cairo the code can be found
`here
<https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/tree/master/src/starkware/cairo/common>`_. It
provides a level of abstraction for common and useful components that can be imported
for use in any Cairo program.

The libraries available are listed below, organized alphabetically. The functions
within each library are outlined under the relevant library heading.

**A note about implicit arguments**: Some descriptions state that the library function
"requires the implicit argument ``<argument>``". Where this is the case, the decision to
pass the argument follows the rule: If the parent function already has the
required argument as an implicit argument, the braces can be omitted. Otherwise, it
should be given explicitly. For example, implicit
arguments may be ``range_check_ptr`` or ``dict_ptr``. See :ref:`implicit_arguments`
for more information.

In the example below, two of the three functions require the implicit argument ``x``.
In ``function_without_implicit_arg()``, a function is called passing argument ``x`` explicitly.
In ``function_with_implicit_arg{x}()``, a function is called passing argument ``x`` implicitly.

.. tested-code:: cairo library_implicits0

    func function_without_implicit_arg():
        let x = 0
        # x must be passed explicitly since it's not an
        # implicit argument of this function.
        function_with_implicit_arg{x=x}()
        return ()
    end

    func function_with_implicit_arg{x}():
        # x is an implicit argument of this function
        # so it does not need to be passed explicitly.
        another_function_with_implicit_arg()
        return ()
    end

    func another_function_with_implicit_arg{x}():
        return ()
    end

.. _common_library_alloc:

``alloc``
---------

This section refers to the common library's
`alloc <https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/cairo/common/alloc.cairo>`_
module.

``alloc()``
***********

Returns a newly allocated memory segment. This is useful when defining dynamically allocated
arrays. As more elements are added, more memory will be allocated.

.. tested-code:: cairo alloc_alloc

    from starkware.cairo.common.alloc import alloc

    # Allocate a memory segment.
    let (new_slot : felt*) = alloc()

    # Allocate a memory segment for an array of structs.
    let (local my_array : MyStruct*) = alloc()

.. _common_library_find_element:

``find_element``
----------------

This section refers to the common library's
`common_find_element <https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/cairo/common/find_element.cairo>`_
module.


``find_element()``
******************

Returns the pointer to an element in an array whose value matches a specified value. The function
uses a hint, whereby the prover arrives at the correct element and then Cairo code verifies that it
is correct. The function has the ability to receive the index of that element, which makes the
operation faster than if the prover has to manually search for the element. The function
requires the implicit argument ``range_check_ptr``.

The function requires four explicit arguments:

-   ``array_ptr``, a pointer to an array (e.g., the pointer ``my_array*``).
-   ``elm_size``, the size of each element in the array (e.g., ``3`` memory slots per element).
-   ``n_elms``, the number of elements in the array (e.g., ``17``).
-   ``key``, the value to look for (e.g., the ``felt`` value ``95``).

The function returns:

-   ``elm_ptr``, the pointer to an element whose first memory cell is ``key``, or raises an
    exception if the value (``key``) is not found.

    -   For an array of ``felt`` elements, this memory cell is a ``felt``. In this way,
        ``find_element()`` finds a felt by its value.
    -   For an array of structs, the first memory cell is the value of the first member. In
        this way, ``find_element()`` finds a struct by its first member.

In the example below, the element index is ``8``, and that information is provided as a global
variable that the prover can access. This allows the ``find_element()`` function to be run by
the prover in constant time. This means that increasing the length of the array
does not increase the time to find the element. If the element index is not provided, the
prover must check every element in the array, which takes linear time. That is, unless the
hint is provided ``__find_element_index`` the function operates in linear time.
If the element index provided is incorrect and points to a cell that has a value
different from ``key``, an exception is raised.

The function will identify an element whose first field value is equal to ``95``.

.. tested-code:: cairo library_find_element

    from starkware.cairo.common.find_element import find_element

    # Optional submission of the index
    __find_element_index = 8

    let element_pointer = find_element(
        array_ptr=my_array*, elm_size=3, n_elms=17, key=95)

Note that if multiple elements in the array have the same value for the first memory cell,
the function may return the index to any of those elements.
