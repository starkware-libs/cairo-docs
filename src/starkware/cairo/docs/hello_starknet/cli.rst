get_transaction
---------------

To get transaction information run the following:

.. tested-code:: bash starknet_get_transaction

    starknet get_transaction --id TRANSACTION_ID

The output should look like:

.. tested-code:: none starknet_get_transaction_output

    {
        "block_id": 1,
        "block_number": 1,
        "status": "PENDING",
        "transaction": {
            "calldata": [
                "1234"
            ],
            "contract_address": "0x039564c4f6d9f45a963a6dc8cf32737f0d51a08e446304626173fd838bd70e1c",
            "entry_point_selector": "0x362398bec32bc0ebb411203221a35a0301193a96f317ebe5e40be9f60d15320",
            "entry_point_type": "EXTERNAL",
            "type": "INVOKE_FUNCTION"
        },
        "transaction_id": 1,
        "transaction_index": 0
    }


The result contains:

*   ``transaction_id`` -- The ID of the transaction, out of all sent transactions.
*   ``status`` -- The status of the transaction. For a detailed list of supported transaction
    statuses, refer to the :ref:`tx_status <tx_status>` usage example.
*   ``transaction`` -- The transaction data.

It may also include each of the following optional fields (according to the transaction's status):

*   ``block_id`` -- The ID of the block containing the transaction.
*   ``block_number`` -- The sequence number of the block containing the transaction.
*   ``transaction_index`` -- The index of the transaction within the block containing it.
*   ``transaction_failure_reason`` -- The reason for the transaction failure.


get_code
--------

Once the ``deploy`` transaction is accepted on-chain, you will be able to see the code of the
contract you have just deployed. The output consists of a list of bytecodes, rather than
the source code. This is because the StarkNet network gets the contract after compilation.

To get the contract at a specific address, run the following command:

.. tested-code:: bash starknet_get_code

    starknet get_code --contract_address CONTRACT_ADDRESS

The output should look like:

.. tested-code:: none starknet_get_code_output

    {
        "abi": [
            {
                "inputs": [
                    {
                        "name": "amount",
                        "type": "felt"
                    }
                ],
                "name": "increase_balance",
                "outputs": [],
                "type": "function"
            },

            ...

            5189976364521848832,
            1,
            5193354034177605632,
            2345108766317314046
        ]
    }


get_block
---------

Instead of querying a specific contract or transaction, you may want to query an entire block and
examine the transactions contained within it.
To do this, run the following:

.. tested-code:: bash starknet_get_block

    starknet get_block --id BLOCK_ID

The output should look like:

.. tested-code:: none starknet_get_block_output

    {
        "block_id": 0,
        "previous_block_id": -1,
        "sequence_number": 0,
        "state_root": "069513ec3fe63e082c841ce3545a1059c54a513295fbd256ba04453953b94a4a",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "timestamp": 105,
        "transaction_receipts": {},
        "transactions": {
            "0": {
                "contract_address": "0x039564c4f6d9f45a963a6dc8cf32737f0d51a08e446304626173fd838bd70e1c",
                "type": "DEPLOY"
            }
        }
    }


.. TODO(Adi, 15/08/2021): Below it should be last *accepted* block.

The result contains:

*   ``block_id`` -- The block ID, a unique identifier of the block.
*   ``previous_block_id`` -- the block ID of the previous block.
*   ``sequence_number`` -- The sequence number of the block, which is the number of
    blocks prior to this block.
*   ``state_root`` -- The root of a Merkle tree representing the StarkNet's state after the given
    block.
*   ``status`` -- The status of the block (for example, ``PENDING``, which means that the block
    was created but has not been accepted on-chain yet).
*   ``timestamp`` -- A timestamp representing the time this block was created.
*   ``transaction_receipts`` -- Information about the transaction status and the corresponding
    L1<->L2 interaction, for every transaction included in the block.
*   ``transactions`` -- A mapping of the transactions included in the block, according to their
    transaction IDs. Note that these are the same IDs used in the ``transaction_receipts`` mapping.

To query the last block, simply remove the ``--id`` argument.

.. _get_storage_at:

get_storage_at
--------------

Other than querying the contract's code, you may also want to query the contract's storage at a
specific key. To do so, you first need to understand which key is of interest to you.
As you saw before, StarkNet introduces a new primitive, which is
:ref:`storage variables <storage_var>`. Each storage variable is mapped to a storage key (a field
element).
To compute this key, run the following python code:

.. tested-code:: python get_variable_key

    from starkware.starknet.public.abi import get_storage_var_address

    balance_key = get_storage_var_address('balance')
    print(f'Balance key: {balance_key}')

You should get:

.. tested-code:: python get_variable_key_output

    Balance key: 916907772491729262376534102982219947830828984996257231353398618781993312401

Now, you can query the balance using:

.. tested-code:: bash starknet_get_storage_at

    starknet get_storage_at \
        --contract_address CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
        --key 916907772491729262376534102982219947830828984996257231353398618781993312401

Using the same contract we have used so far, you should get:

.. tested-code:: none starknet_get_storage_at_output

    1234

Note that this is the same result obtained by the call to ``get_balance``.


Later on, at the :ref:`user authentication <user_authentication>` section, you will see :ref:`a
generalization of storage variables <storage_maps>`, which allow, for example, a balance
variable for each user. This will require minor adjustments to the code above, which we will review
in the relevant section.

.. TODO(Adi, 15/08/2021): At the end of the second paragraph below, change to last *accepted* block.

Block-specific queries
**********************

Some of the aforementioned CLI functions have an additional argument, ``--block_id``, which
applies the given query to a specific block.
For example, you may want to query the balance variable at some specific point in time.

To find out whether a CLI function can be executed as a block-specific query, simply use the
``--help`` argument to see if ``--block_id`` is part of the optional arguments for that function.
In case you do not use the ``--block_id`` argument, the query will be applied to the last block.
