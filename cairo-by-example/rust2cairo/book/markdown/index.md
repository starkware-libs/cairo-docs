# Rust2Cairo By Example

[Cairo][cairo] is a modern programming language that lets you write ZK-provable programs without requiring a deep understanding of the underlying ZK concepts.

Cairo is heavily inspired by Rust, making it easier for developers familiar with Rust to build scalable dApps with the power of validity proofs.

Rust2Cairo (R2CBE) is a collection of runnable examples that highlight the differences between Cairo and Rust.

To get even more out of these examples, don't forget
to [install Cairo locally][install] and check out [The Cairo Book][book].
