= Welcome to Cairo 1.0

Cairo is a programming language and a virtual
machine that enables developers to create highly performant and secure smart contracts on
blockchains. Developed by StarkWare, Cairo is specifically designed to address the challenges of scalability and privacy in decentralized applications.

With its simplified syntax and efficient execution, Cairo allows developers to write complex contracts in a more accessible manner, while maintaining the highest level of security and reliability.

This documentation provides an overview of the implementation of the Cairo virtual machine and a
compiler, enabling developers to create, test and deploy smart contracts on different blockchain platforms.
